[33m[1mCMake Warning[0m at /home/kkraman/rio_ws/src/navigation-melodic-devel/frontier_exploration/frontier_exploration/CMakeLists.txt:65 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgtest.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "gtest", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gtest" with any of
  the following names:

    gtestConfig.cmake
    gtest-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gtest" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gtest_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "gtest"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
